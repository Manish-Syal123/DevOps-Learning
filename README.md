# second-method
This is the commit which i made on git hub itself for using command for fetching data

>>>MAKE SURE WHILE PERFORMING THE BELOW COMMANDS YOU ARE ON MASTER BRANCH OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE<<< 
> ~ git pull origin master
  <If we want to push from origin means from where we had fork the project, we use>
> ~ git pull upstream main or master
-----Or you can use------
> ~ git reset --hard upstream/main or master
  <THIS WILL ALSO FETCH THE DATA FROM UPSTREAM>
-----Or you can use------
> ~ git fetch --all --prune   # prun means the commits that i have deleted they also get fetched
